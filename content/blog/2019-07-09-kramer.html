<p>If you’ve used the internet this year, you’re likely aware of the fact that people are naming their children after popular characters from HBO’s Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve seen a chart like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2019-07-09-kramer_files/figure-html/Daenerys%20All-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In 2016, more than 100 children were named after the Game of Thrones character Daenerys.</p>
<p><strong>No one</strong> named their child Daenerys before show’s debut in 2011. It’s safe to conclude that the show was responsible for the child’s name and identity going forward in life.</p>
<p>Working from the ever-popular <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/us-baby-names">babynames dataset</a>, I wanted to see if people were naming their children after characters that closely follow the Game of Thrones pattern.</p>
<p>Did anyone name their child <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUdaWZ4FN0">Seven like George wanted to in Seinfeld?</a> What about <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0493037/">Beans from Even Stevens,</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_Buffay">Phoebe from Friends?</a></p>
<div id="criteria" class="section level4">
<h4>Criteria:</h4>
<p>A. Less than 50 children per year shared a character’s name before the respective show’s debut.</p>

<h3>The results are divided into three groups.</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Honorable Mentions - Barely missed 25 per year mark.</li>
<li>Truly Odd <strong>&lt; 50</strong> uses per year before the show’s debut.</li>
<li>Too weird for any parent.</li>

<h3>Honorable Mention Category</h3>
<p><img src="/blog/2019-07-09-kramer_files/figure-html/honorable%20mentions-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Lorelei, Gilmore Girls (2000 to 2007)</li>
<li>Phoebe, Friends (1994 to 2004)</li>
<li>Rory, Gilmore Girls (2000 to 2007)</li>
<li>Sheldon, Big Bang Theory (2007 to It Will Never End)</li>
</ol>
<p>The popularity of the Big Bang Theory spawned a prequel of a show inside of a show that is <strong>still running.</strong> I figured Sheldon would be a lot higher.</p>
<p>Even though Phoebe missed the cut, the data shows that Friends has transformed Phoebe into a moderately popular named when compared to it’s past frequency.</p>

<h3>Truly Odd.</h3>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Creed, The Office (2005)</li>
<li>Gunther, Friends (1994 - 2004)</li>
<li>Kramer, Seinfeld (1989 - 1998)</li>
<li>Seven, Seinfeld (1989 - 1998)</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes… That <strong>Creed Bratton</strong> line is accurate!
<br>
Yes… People were, and still are, naming their children “Seven!”</p>
<p>To further prove the point, here is the average number of names, per year, adjusted for the show’s time on television.</p>

<p>I then figured that Creed must have been a very popular name sometime in the past and now it is just coming back into style.

To be fair, Creed was on the rise before The Office debuted in 2005; however, It’s safe to say that some of the inspiration is from the character depicted on the show.</p>

<h3>Too weird for literally anyone.</h3>
<p>No one, and I mean no one, has named their child after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXOISYS5ubY&amp;t=29s">Beans</a> from Even Stevens. When Shia LaBeouf filmed himself watching himself in all of the movies he has ever starred in, he cried <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXOISYS5ubY&amp;t=29s">in only one</a>.</p>
