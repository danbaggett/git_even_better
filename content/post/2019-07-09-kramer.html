<p>If you’ve used the internet this year, you’re likely aware of the fact that people are naming their children after popular characters from HBO’s Game of Thrones.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-09-kramer_files/figure-html/Daenerys%20All-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The data shows that <strong>no one</strong> in America named their child Daenerys before show’s debut in 2011. By 2016, more than 100 families were choosing the name Daenerys. The memes are coming to life! <img src="/post/2019-07-09-kramer_files/Danny%20Meme.png" /></p>
<p>Working from the ever-popular <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/us-baby-names">babynames dataset</a>, I wanted to see if people were naming their children after characters that closely follow the Game of Thrones pattern. Essentially, I was looking for truly odd character names from television that have never, or almost never, been used before in American History dating back to 1880.</p>
<p>For example, did anyone name their child <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUdaWZ4FN0">Seven like George wanted to in Seinfeld?</a> What about <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0493037/">Beans from Even Stevens,</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_Buffay">Phoebe from Friends?</a></p>
<div id="criteria" class="section level4">
<h4>Criteria</h4>
<p>To be <strong>truly odd</strong> like Daenerys, less than 50 children per year could share a character’s name before the year of the show’s debut.</p>

<h3>The results are divided into three groups.</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Honorable Mentions - (Barely exceeded 50 names per year before show’s debut.)</li>
<li>Truly Odd (<strong>&lt; 50</strong> uses per year before the show’s debut.)</li>
<li>Too weird for any parent.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Honorable Mention Category</h3>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-09-kramer_files/figure-html/honorable%20mentions-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Lorelei, Gilmore Girls (2000 to 2007)</li>
<li>Phoebe, Friends (1994 to 2004)</li>
<li>Rory, Gilmore Girls (2000 to 2007)</li>
<li>Sheldon, Big Bang Theory (2007 to It Will Never End)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Big Bang Theory was popular enough to spawn a prequel of a show inside of a show that is <strong>still running.</strong> I figured Sheldon would be a lot higher.</p>
<p>Even though Phoebe missed the cut, the data shows that Friends transformed Phoebe into a moderately popular name when compared to it’s past usage.</p>

<li>Gunther, Friends (1994 - 2004)</li>
<li>Kramer, Seinfeld (1989 - 1998)</li>
<li>Seven, Seinfeld (1989 - 1998)</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes… That <strong>Creed Bratton</strong> line is accurate!
<br>
Yes… People were, and still are, naming their children “Seven!”</p>
<p>To further prove the point, here is the average number of names, per year, adjusted for the show’s time on television.</p>

<p>I then figured that Creed must have been a very popular name sometime in the past and the name is <em>just now</em> coming back into style.

<br/>
To be fair, Creed was on the rise before The Office debuted in 2005; however, It’s safe to say that some of the inspiration is from the character depicted on the show.<br />

<h3>Too weird for literally anyone.</h3>
<p>No one, and I mean no one, has named their child after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXOISYS5ubY&amp;t=29s">Beans</a> from Even Stevens. When Shia LaBeouf filmed himself watching himself in all of the movies he has ever starred in, he cried <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXOISYS5ubY&amp;t=29s">in only one</a>. <img src="/post/2019-07-09-kramer_files/Shia%20Crying.png" /></p>
