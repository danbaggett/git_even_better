      <description>“Write three things you learned about Ulysses S. Grant that you didn’t already know before taking this class.”
Roughly 100 college students responded to this prompt on their latest assignment in an American History II class I teach.
Their top answer: “I didn’t know Grant was a president.”
It’s not that important to know that Ulysses S. Grant was a president before taking an American History class. Presidential facts are not a quality measurement of anyone’s intelligence.</description>

      <title>People Are Naming Their Children After Creed Bratton</title>

      <description>If you’ve used the internet this year, you’re likely aware of the fact that people are naming their children after popular characters from HBO’s Game of Thrones.
Maybe you’ve seen a chart like this:
In 2016, more than 100 children were named after the Game of Thrones character Daenerys.
No one named their child Daenerys before show’s debut in 2011. It’s safe to conclude that the show was responsible for the child’s name and identity going forward in life.</description>

      <description>true  If you’ve used the internet this year, you’re likely aware of the fact that people are naming their children after popular characters from HBO’s Game of Thrones.
Maybe you’ve seen a chart like this:
In 2016, more than 100 children were named after Daenerys.
This Game of Thrones experiment is pretty popular for one obvious reason:
No one named their child Daenerys before show’s debut in 2011. It’s safe to conclude that the show was responsible for the child’s name and identity going forward in life.</description>
