      <description>Yelp has kindly made a few datasets available for free for data analysts. I was particularly interested in running the reviews through sentiment analysis lexicons. I wondered how much the intensity of negative or postive reviews would change in relation to the type of business being reviewed. Medical offices seemed like a good fit to start with.
For example: Are customers more likely to give a doctor’s office a negative or positive review than say a restaurant or a movie theatre?</description>

      <description>Each year, Outreach Magazine and Lifeway Research colloborate to produce the “Outreach 100.” The two companies survey churches, verify data, and then compile lists of the fastest growing churches and the largest churches in America. They’ve recently made some of this information available for free on their website.
I wanted to visualize some of their data. Every church on the “Outreach 100” has an HTML Table associated with it. Using R I was able to arrange the HTML tables into something more useful.</description>

      <description>“Write three things you learned about Ulysses S. Grant that you didn’t already know before taking this class.”
Roughly 100 college students responded to this prompt on their latest assignment in an American History II class I teach.
Their top answer: “I didn’t know Grant was a president.”
It’s not that important to know that Ulysses S. Grant was a president before taking an American History class. Knowledge of presidential facts is not an accurate measurement of anyone’s intelligence.</description>

      <title>People Are Naming Their Children After Creed Bratton</title>

      <description>If you’ve used the internet this year, you’re likely aware of the fact that people are naming their children after popular characters from HBO’s Game of Thrones.
The data shows that no one in America named their child Daenerys before the show’s debut in 2011. By 2016, more than 100 families were choosing the name Daenerys. The memes are coming to life! Working from the ever-popular babynames dataset, I wanted to see if people were naming their children after characters that closely follow the Game of Thrones pattern.</description>
