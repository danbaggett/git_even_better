      <description>“Write three things you learned about Ulysses S. Grant that you didn’t already know before taking this class.”
Roughly 100 college students responded to this prompt on their latest assignment in an American History II class I teach.
Their top answer: “I didn’t know Grant was a president.”
It’s not that important to know that Ulysses S. Grant was a president before taking an American History class. Presidential facts are not a quality measurement of anyone’s intelligence.</description>
