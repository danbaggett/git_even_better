      <description>true  If you’ve used the internet this year, you’re likely aware of the fact that people are naming their children after popular characters from HBO’s Game of Thrones.
Maybe you’ve seen a chart like this:
In 2016, more than 100 children were named after Daenerys.

No one named their child Daenerys before show’s debut in 2011. It’s safe to conclude that the show was responsible for the child’s name and identity going forward in life.</description>
