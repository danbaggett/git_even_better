Their annual reports detail the fastest growing churches in America and the largest chuches in America. A lot of the information is available for free on their website.\nThe data on the website is great, but I wanted to visualize what was available for free in a different way. Every church on the “Outreach 100” has an HTML Table associated with it. Using Rstudio I was able to arrange the HTML tables into something more useful.\nFor Example: The graphic above shows the largest 25 churches in America for 2018 according to Lifeway and Outreach Magazine. quick glance at the list above sparks a lot of questions that I’d love to answer here; however, I will only work with data that is available for free on their website. I’ll work though five exploratory thoughts I had after I initially got the data. If you’re interested in the code, you can find it on github.\n\n 5 Questions Answered 1. How do the 100 largest churches break down in regards to affiliation? I anticipated nondenominational churches to dominate the 2018 list; still, I didn’t expect it to be that After looking at the list above, I visited the websites of 10-15 churches graphic above that do declare their affiliation. Even the affiliated churches seem hesitant to broadcast which denomination they belong to.\n\n 2. Are large churches still growing?  The graphic above only includes the last four years because it is all that is available via Outreach. I also filtered the graphic down to churches that added at least 3,000 people in the last four years to make it managable to read.\n Church of the Highlands stands out on nearly every graphic I make. They have added 15,000 people in four years. It’s is simply incredible.\n  \n 3. The Rise of Multisite?  4. How big are the multisite campuses?  Obviously, the ratio above does not represent the exact amount of people at each campus. I just wanted to get an idea of each church’s philosophy on when they thought it was time to plant a new church, or when it was time to add add a satellite campus.\n I also wanted to see the rate at which churches were adding campuses. The dataset does not allow me to see number of campuses added year by year.\n  Final Thoughts  A bevy of nondenominational churches are quickly creating networks of smaller churches that share core beliefs, values etc. so that people can experience something similar whereever they go. A cynic would say that nondenominational churches are slowly creating… denominations. I think the situation requires more nuance.  \n   ","href":"/post/exploring-the-largest-100-churches-in-america/","title":"Looking At The Largest 100 Churches In America"},{"content":"","href":"/post/","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/church/","title":"church"},{"content":" “Write three things you learned about Ulysses S. Grant that you didn’t already know before taking this class.”\nRoughly 100 college students responded to this prompt on their latest assignment in an American History II class I teach.\nTheir top answer: “I didn’t know Grant was a president.”\nIt’s not that important to know that Ulysses S. Grant was a president before taking an American History class. Knowledge of presidential facts is not an accurate measurement of anyone’s intelligence. I forget simple things I learned in the past all the time. I might have even googled a picture of a $50 bill while grading papers.\nIt is important that nearly every student that admitted to not knowing about Grant apologized or expressed embarressment for not knowing. A few told me they were just “bad at history.” If almost every student was apologetic, how many more students were afraid to admit it? Even worse, how often am I teaching things that require prior information that many students are embarressed to admit they don’t have.\nUsing Google Trends, I downloaded the top 25 related queries in connection to “Ulysses S. Grant.” Related queries allow me to see what else the same user was searching for in connection to Ulysses S Grant. As Nick Churick explains, related queries help explain a users “search journey”\nTo get an idea of what related queries look like, below are the top 5 searches related to Ulysses S. Grant over the last 15 years.\n“A president?” sure fits pretty nicely at the end of #1.\n***\nWhat do people know about Grant? 2014-2019 I downloaded the related queries for the last 15 years, categorized them, and then used Rstudio to see if they could be displayed into something useful. Grant’s Presidency doesn’t make the top 25. The closest association to his presidency falls under the “General Search” column. Here, the related queries were comprised of questions like: “Who was Ulysses S. Grant?” Grant’s association with the Civil War isn’t surprising either. I’d hesitate to extrapolate too much from this. The Civil War is incredibly popular and it’s possible that the weight of the event is pulling Grant-related searches along with it. Every High School student in America will need to google the Civil War at some point and it’s likely that they’ll eventually hit Grant.\nThe most informative part of this graph is the relatively low association of Grant and Reconstruction. Grant’s Presidency spans one of the most important events in American History and I was hoping Reconstruction would rank a bit higher.\n 2018-2019 I ran the same graph below but only used related-searches for the last calendar year.\nThis graph shows a more even distribution of Grant-related searches. The Civil War still provides the strongest association; however, his presidency more than made it into the top 25. Why the sudden jump in Grant’s presidency? I’m not really sure. Eric Foner’s work on Reconstruction, or Ron Chernow’s excellent biography of Grant are quite good. Maybe podcasts like Slate’s on Reconstruction or the fantastic Presidential series have made a recent dent.\nNone of this information is particularly useful on its own. I didn’t expect it to be. It will be useful on Monday when I can show my students that a lot of people forget basic facts, or never learned them in the first place and it absolutely does not mean they should apologize for not knowing.\n  ","href":"/post/i-m-sorry-i-didn-t-know-that/","title":"I'm Sorry I Didn't Know That"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/","title":"Tags"},{"content":" So does this pull to blog?\n","href":"/post/will-this-get-tagged-to-blog/","title":"Will this get tagged to blog?"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/features/","title":"features"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/history/","title":"history"},{"content":" If you’ve used the internet this year, you’re likely aware of the fact that people are naming their children after popular characters from HBO’s Game of Thrones.\nMaybe you’ve seen a chart like this:\nIn 2016, more than 100 children were named after the Game of Thrones character Daenerys.\nNo one named their child Daenerys before show’s debut in 2011. It’s safe to conclude that the show was responsible for the child’s name and identity going forward in life.\nWorking from the ever-popular babynames dataset, I wanted to see if people were naming their children after characters that closely follow the Game of Thrones pattern.\nDid anyone name their child Seven like George wanted to in Seinfeld?
