I was particularly interested in running the reviews through sentiment analysis lexicons. I wondered how much the intensity of negative or postive reviews would change in relation to the type of business being reviewed. Medical offices seemed like a good fit to start with.\nFor example: Are customers more likely to give a doctor’s office a negative or positive review than say a restaurant or a movie theatre? Will reviewers show more nuance with respect to higher-skill jobs?\nBelow you can see how the data is divided.\n Yelp reviews from medical categories only. (These were routinely outpatient offices)\n Yelp Reviews from every other type of business.\n  doctors \u0026lt;- reviews %\u0026gt;% filter(str_detect(business_categories, \u0026quot;Doctors\u0026quot;)) reviews \u0026lt;- reviews %\u0026gt;% mutate(medical = ifelse(str_detect(business_categories, \u0026quot;Doctors\u0026quot;), TRUE, FALSE)) No Room For The Middle  Medical offices are clearly playing by a different set of rules in the customer’s mind.\n The middle of chart #1 is hollowed out when compared to chart #2.\n The polarization is best seen by comparing the four star distribution. Restraunts, theatres, etc. are reviewed with a bit more grace or nuance.\n The percentage of 5 star reviews are almost even between the two fields. If a patient has a good experience at a medical office, they are clearly willing to reciprocate and share their experience online. Obviously, the opposite is also true.\n Medical offices were three times more likely to receive a one star review on Yelp.    stars All Businesses percent    1 17189 7.523822      stars Medical Offices percent    1 159 23.76682     Sentiment Analysis Why are medical offices receiving a higher proportion of negative reviews? A closer look a the most used words should provide some answers.\nFirst, the text from the reviews were tokenized and then filtered against a lexicon of stopwords.\n#Tokenize Words doctors_nest \u0026lt;- doctors %\u0026gt;% select(business_id, stars, text) %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(word, text) #Remove Stop Words doctors_stop \u0026lt;- doctors_nest %\u0026gt;% anti_join(stop_words) ## Joining, by = \u0026quot;word\u0026quot; Beyond tokenizing the words, I also grouped some terms together. Reviwers often misspell words or use abbreviations. The code below shows how certain terms were group together. For example, “dr”, “doctors”, etc. were grouped together as simply “doctor.”\ndoctors_stop_coded \u0026lt;- doctors_stop %\u0026gt;% mutate(word = fct_collapse(word, doctor = c(\u0026quot;dr\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;doctors\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;doctor\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;minutes, hours, etc.\u0026quot; = c(\u0026quot;minutes\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hours\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;wait\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;waiting\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;time\u0026quot;), numbers = c(\u0026quot;2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;3\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;5\u0026quot;), money = c(\u0026quot;bill\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;money\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;days, weeks, etc.\u0026quot; = c(\u0026quot;days\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;weeks\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;months\u0026quot;)))   1 Star \u0026amp; 5 Star  At first glance, these two charts appear identical. They are not!\n These two charts make it clear: the doctor, the amount of time a patient waits, and the staff that a patient interacts with are the most critical elements to either a great or terrible experience.\n   1 Star Words  How could the word “told” be so high? Phrases like “She told me it cost x” or “I was told it would be x more minutes”, etc. appeared repeatedly in one star reviews.\n The data also shows that outpaitent offices should be as realistic as possible in regards to wait times and costs. Patients obviously prefer bad news on the front end and they really don’t like it when they feel like they were lied to.\n I expected the word “insurance” to rank much higher. If the reviews were based on hospitals, complaints related to insurance companies would likely appear more frequently.  ## 5 Star Words  The word “friendly” was used 122 times in the bank 5 Star Reviews. It was used 0 times in the set of 1 star reviews.\n Almost everything can wrong for a patient; and still, if a patient experiences kindness from just one person, the data shows that it actually does make a difference.\n   ","href":"/post/yelp-reviews-of-doctor-s-offices-analyzed/","title":"Medical Offices \u0026 One Star Reviews"},{"content":"","href":"/post/","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":" Each year, Outreach Magazine and Lifeway Research colloborate to produce the “Outreach 100.” The two companies survey churches, verify data, and then compile lists of the fastest growing churches and the largest churches in America. They’ve recently made some of this information available for free on their website.\nI wanted to visualize some of their data. Every church on the “Outreach 100” has an HTML Table associated with it. Using R I was able to arrange the HTML tables into something more useful.\nFor Example: A quick glance at the list above sparks a lot of questions that I’d love to answer here; however, I will only work with data that is available for free on their website. I’ll work though a few exploratory visualizations I made.\n\n1. How do the 100 largest churches break down in regards to affiliation?  I anticipated nondenominational churches to dominate the 2018 list; still, I didn’t expect it to be this overwhelming. Also, I visited the websites of 10-15 churches that do declare their affiliation. I was looking to see how, or if, they communicated their respective denomination. Many of the churches on the list make their respecitve affiliation difficult to find.  \n  2. Are large churches still growing?  Church of the Highlands stands out in nearly every graphic I make. They have added 15,000 people in four years. It’s kind of staggering.\n Alabama’s population is approximately 4.8 million. This means that Church of the Highlands represents nearly 1% of Alabama’s population and they are still growing rapidly. No other church on the list comes close to this kind of population / state ratio.\n The data above only includes the last four years because it is all that is available via Outreach. I also filtered the data down to churches that added at least 3,000 people in the last four years to make it managable to read.\n  \n 3. Two looks at multisite models.  Obviously, the second graphic does not represent the exact amount of people at each campus. I wanted to get an idea of each church’s philosophy in regards to when they thought it was time to plant a new church, or when they believed it was time to add a satellite campus.\n I also wanted to see the rate at which churches were adding campuses. The dataset does not allow me to see number of campuses added year by year.\n  Final Thoughts  A bevy of nondenominational churches are quickly creating networks of smaller churches that share core beliefs, values etc. so that people can experience something similar where ever they go. A cynic would say that nondenominational churches are slowly creating… denominations. I think the situation requires more nuance.  \n  ","href":"/post/exploring-the-largest-100-churches-in-america/","title":"Looking At The Largest 100 Churches In America"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/church/","title":"church"},{"content":" “Write three things you learned about Ulysses S. Grant that you didn’t already know before taking this class.”\nRoughly 100 college students responded to this prompt on their latest assignment in an American History II class I teach.\nTheir top answer: “I didn’t know Grant was a president.”\nIt’s not that important to know that Ulysses S. Grant was a president before taking an American History class. Knowledge of presidential facts is not an accurate measurement of anyone’s intelligence. I forget simple things I learned in the past all the time. I might have even googled a picture of a $50 bill while grading papers.\nIt is important that nearly every student that admitted to not knowing about Grant apologized or expressed embarressment for not knowing. A few told me they were just “bad at history.” If almost every student was apologetic, how many more students were afraid to admit it? Even worse, how often am I teaching things that require prior information that many students are embarressed to admit they don’t have.\nUsing Google Trends, I downloaded the top 25 related queries in connection to “Ulysses S. Grant.” Related queries allow me to see what else the same user was searching for in connection to Ulysses S Grant. As Nick Churick explains, related queries help explain a users “search journey”\nTo get an idea of what related queries look like, below are the top 5 searches related to Ulysses S. Grant over the last 15 years.\n“A president?” sure fits pretty nicely at the end of #1.\n***\nWhat do people know about Grant? 2014-2019 I downloaded the related queries for the last 15 years, categorized them, and then used Rstudio to see if they could be displayed into something useful. Grant’s Presidency doesn’t make the top 25. The closest association to his presidency falls under the “General Search” column. Here, the related queries were comprised of questions like: “Who was Ulysses S. Grant?” Grant’s association with the Civil War isn’t surprising either. I’d hesitate to extrapolate too much from this. The Civil War is incredibly popular and it’s possible that the weight of the event is pulling Grant-related searches along with it. Every High School student in America will need to google the Civil War at some point and it’s likely that they’ll eventually hit Grant.\nThe most informative part of this graph is the relatively low association of Grant and Reconstruction. Grant’s Presidency spans one of the most important events in American History and I was hoping Reconstruction would rank a bit higher.\n 2018-2019 I ran the same graph below but only used related-searches for the last calendar year.\nThis graph shows a more even distribution of Grant-related searches. The Civil War still provides the strongest association; however, his presidency more than made it into the top 25. Why the sudden jump in Grant’s presidency? I’m not really sure. Eric Foner’s work on Reconstruction, or Ron Chernow’s excellent biography of Grant are quite good. Maybe podcasts like Slate’s on Reconstruction or the fantastic Presidential series have made a recent dent.\nNone of this information is particularly useful on its own. I didn’t expect it to be. It will be useful on Monday when I can show my students that a lot of people forget basic facts, or never learned them in the first place and it absolutely does not mean they should apologize for not knowing.\n  ","href":"/post/i-m-sorry-i-didn-t-know-that/","title":"Google Trends \u0026 Ulysses S.

By 2016, more than 100 families were choosing the name Daenerys. The memes are coming to life! Working from the ever-popular babynames dataset, I wanted to see if people were naming their children after characters that closely follow the Game of Thrones pattern. Essentially, I was looking for truly odd character names from television that have never, or almost never, been used before in American History dating back to 1880.\nFor example, did anyone name their child Seven like George wanted to in Seinfeld? What about Beans from Even Stevens, or Phoebe from Friends?\nCriteria To be truly odd like Daenerys, less than 50 children per year could share a character’s name before the year of the show’s debut.\n The results are divided into three groups. Honorable Mentions - (Barely exceeded 50 names per year before show’s debut.) Truly Odd (\u0026lt; 50 uses per year before the show’s debut.) Too weird for any parent.   Honorable Mention Category Lorelei, Gilmore Girls (2000 to 2007) Phoebe, Friends (1994 to 2004) Rory, Gilmore Girls (2000 to 2007) Sheldon, Big Bang Theory (2007 to It Will Never End)  The Big Bang Theory was popular enough to spawn a prequel of a show inside of a show that is still running. I figured Sheldon would be a lot higher.\nEven though Phoebe missed the cut, the data shows that Friends transformed Phoebe into a moderately popular name when compared to it’s past usage.\n Truly Odd. Creed, The Office (2005) Gunther, Friends (1994 - 2004) Kramer, Seinfeld (1989 - 1998) Seven, Seinfeld (1989 - 1998)  Yes… That Creed Bratton line is accurate! Yes… People were, and still are, naming their children “Seven!”\nTo further prove the point, here is the average number of names, per year, adjusted for the show’s time on television.\nI then figured that Creed must have been a very popular name sometime in the past and the name is just now coming back into style. \n To be fair, Creed was on the rise before The Office debuted in 2005; however, It’s safe to say that some of the inspiration is from the character depicted on the show.\n\n Too weird for literally anyone. No one, and I mean no one, has named their child after Beans from Even Stevens. When Shia LaBeouf filmed himself watching himself in all of the movies he has ever starred in, he cried in only one.
