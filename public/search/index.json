Grant that you didn’t already know before taking this class.”\nRoughly 100 college students responded to this prompt on their latest assignment in an American History II class I teach.\nTheir top answer: “I didn’t know Grant was a president.”\nIt’s not that important to know that Ulysses S. Grant was a president before taking an American History class. Knowledge of presidential facts is not an accurate measurement of anyone’s intelligence. I forget simple things I learned in the past all the time. I might have even googled a picture of a $50 bill while grading papers.\nIt is important that nearly every student that admitted to not knowing about Grant apologized or expressed embarressment for not knowing. A few told me they were just “bad at history.” If almost every student was apologetic, how many more students were afraid to admit it? Even worse, how often am I teaching things that require prior information that many students are embarressed to admit they don’t have.\nUsing Google Trends, I downloaded the top 25 related queries in connection to “Ulysses S. Grant.” Related queries allow me to see what else the same user was searching for in connection to Ulysses S Grant. As Nick Churick explains, related queries help explain a users “search journey”\nTo get an idea of what related queries look like, below are the top 5 searches related to Ulysses S. Grant over the last 15 years.\n“A president?” sure fits pretty nicely at the end of #1.\n***\nWhat do people know about Grant? 2014-2019 I downloaded the related queries for the last 15 years, categorized them, and then used Rstudio to see if they could be displayed into something useful. Grant’s Presidency doesn’t make the top 25. The closest association to his presidency falls under the “General Search” column. Here, the related queries were comprised of questions like: “Who was Ulysses S. Grant?” Grant’s association with the Civil War isn’t surprising either. I’d hesitate to extrapolate too much from this. The Civil War is incredibly popular and it’s possible that the weight of the event is pulling Grant-related searches along with it. Every High School student in America will need to google the Civil War at some point and it’s likely that they’ll eventually hit Grant.\nThe most informative part of this graph is the relatively low association of Grant and Reconstruction. Grant’s Presidency spans one of the most important events in American History and I was hoping Reconstruction would rank a bit higher.\n 2018-2019 I ran the same graph below but only used related-searches for the last calendar year.\nThis graph shows a more even distribution of Grant-related searches. The Civil War still provides the strongest association; however, his presidency more than made it into the top 25. Why the sudden jump in Grant’s presidency? I’m not really sure. Eric Foner’s work on Reconstruction, or Ron Chernow’s excellent biography of Grant are quite good. Maybe podcasts like Slate’s on Reconstruction or the fantastic Presidential series have made a recent dent.\nNone of this information is particularly useful on its own. I didn’t expect it to be. It will be useful on Monday when I can show my students that a lot of people forget basic facts, or never learned them in the first place and it absolutely does not mean they should apologize for not knowing.\n  ","href":"/blog/100-students-on-president-grant/","title":"I'm Sorry I Didn't Know That"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":" So where does this show up?\n","href":"/post/minimal_daniel/","title":"Minimal Post Daniel"},{"content":"","href":"/post/","title":"Posts"},{"content":" Where the hell do new posts go and why are they called Docs.\n","href":"/post/where-does-this-go/","title":"Where does this go?"},{"content":" Where is this.\n","href":"/blog/will-the-serve-site-work/","title":"Will the Serve Site Work"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/others/","title":"others"},{"content":" If you’ve used the internet this year, you’re likely aware of the fact that people are naming their children after popular characters from HBO’s Game of Thrones.\nMaybe you’ve seen a chart like this:\nIn 2016, more than 100 children were named after the Game of Thrones character Daenerys.\nNo one named their child Daenerys before show’s debut in 2011. It’s safe to conclude that the show was responsible for the child’s name and identity going forward in life.\nWorking from the ever-popular babynames dataset, I wanted to see if people were naming their children after characters that closely follow the Game of Thrones pattern.\nDid anyone name their child Seven like George wanted to in Seinfeld? What about Beans from Even Stevens, or Phoebe from Friends?\nCriteria: A.

I figured Sheldon would be a lot higher.\nEven though Phoebe missed the cut, the data shows that Friends has transformed Phoebe into a moderately popular named when compared to it’s past frequency.\n Truly Odd.

Yes… People were, and still are, naming their children “Seven!”\nTo further prove the point, here is the average number of names, per year, adjusted for the show’s time on television.\nI then figured that Creed must have been a very popular name sometime in the past and now it is just coming back into style. To be fair, Creed was on the rise before The Office debuted in 2005; however, It’s safe to say that some of the inspiration is from the character depicted on the show.\n Too weird for literally anyone. No one, and I mean no one, has named their child after Beans from Even Stevens.
